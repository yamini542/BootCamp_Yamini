## 🚚 Day 1: Optimizing Delivery Routes with Dijkstra’s Algorithm

### 📌 Problem
Given a network of delivery points, find the fastest route from a warehouse to the customer.

### ⚙️ Solution
We used Dijkstra's algorithm to compute the shortest path in a weighted graph.

### 🔍 Real-World Use
This model can be used by logistics companies like Royal Mail to optimize route planning.

### 🛠 Tech Used
Python, heapq, dictionary-based graph.

### 🧠 What I Learned
- Graph modeling of real-world routes
- Efficient pathfinding
- Clean, readable algorithm design
