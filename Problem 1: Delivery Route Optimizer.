Problem 1: Delivery Route Optimizer
Youâ€™re working for a UK delivery company (like DPD or Royal Mail).
They want to minimize delivery time between stations, based on traffic-adjusted routes.
Your job: Write a system that, given any starting warehouse, will calculate the fastest path to all delivery locations.

ðŸ’¡ This is a classic graph problem, and weâ€™ll solve it using Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm (fastest path in a weighted graph).

ðŸ”§ Step 1: Understand the Graph Structure
Each delivery station is a node, and the roads (with time) are edges.

Hereâ€™s a simple example graph:

Warehouse --2--> A --1--> B --3--> Customer
     \                              /
      \--------5--------> B ------- 

Explanation of a graph: Here from warehouse to location name : A takes 2 minutes to travel, 1 min from A to B, B to customer it takes 3 minutes and there is a one direct rout takes Warehouse to B to customer toal 5 minutes 
we have here different types of ways to now as per put job we need to find out the best route to do the delivery fast.
So overall, there are two ways to get to the Customer:

Warehouse â†’ A (2) â†’ B (1) â†’ Customer (3) â†’ Total = 6 mins

Warehouse â†’ B (5) â†’ Customer (3) â†’ Total = 8 mins

If we use the Dijkstra's algorithm, It will figure out the fastest one = 6 minutes, which goes through A and B.

Instead of doing the maths calulation lets write a simple code for this.
